# EKT.tmBundle

A TextMate language bundle for [EKT](https://github.com/shadowfacts/ekt).

## Usage
This tmBundle also requires the Kotlin language to be present to function properly.

**Note:** In IntelliJ IDEA, the HTML and Kotlin tmLanguages to be added alongside this, as the default syntax highlighting for those languages cannot be referenced from a tmLanguage.
